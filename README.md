# Redux Promise State

`redux-promised-state` is a redux middleware that maps Promise semantics to state semantics.  A promise is excellent for representing in-process API calls.  Promises aren't great for making rendering decisions.  `redux-promised-state` converts a dispatched promise action into an object representing the current state of the promise.

## Installation

```
npm i redux-promise-state

## Usage

### Install the middleware

### Dispatch a Promise action

### Handle PromisedState actions
